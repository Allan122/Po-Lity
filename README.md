2. **Administrative Costs:**
   - **Governance:** The costs of setting up and maintaining a complex administrative structure were significant.
   - **Corruption:** Widespread corruption meant that a substantial portion of revenue did not reach the Company’s coffers, contributing to its financial woes.

3. **Inefficient Management:**
