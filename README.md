#### Impact on Bengal, Orissa, and Bihar

1. **Revenue Collection:**
   - **Land Revenue System:** The Company implemented a land revenue system to maximize revenue extraction. This often led to higher taxes and exploitation of peasants.
   - **Permanent Settlement (1793):** Introduced by Lord Cornwallis, it fixed land revenues and created a class of zamindars who were responsible for tax collection. This system was detrimental to peasants as it did not consider agricultural productivity variations.

   - **Drain of Wealth:** Revenue collected from Bengal, Orissa, and Bihar was used to fund the Company's military and administrative expenses, leading to a significant outflow of wealth from these regions to Britain.
   - **Monopoly on Trade:** The Company monopolized the trade of key commodities like silk, cotton, and opium, disrupting local economies and traditional industries.

   - **Wars and Conflicts:** Continuous military campaigns, including the Battle of Plassey, Battle of Buxar, and various local conflicts, led to enormous expenditures.

2. **Administrative Costs:**
   - **Governance:** The costs of setting up and maintaining a complex administrative structure were significant.
   - **Corruption:** Widespread corruption meant that a substantial portion of revenue did not reach the Company’s coffers, contributing to its financial woes.

3. **Inefficient Management:**
